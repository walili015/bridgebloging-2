<p><strong>Insurance is not sexy, but it is still necessary to protect yourself against certain risks in life. So you have to deal with this rather dry matter now and then for better or worse. Most of them only do the bare minimum, look for the best price or let the trusted broker put together a nice package. But that is also the reason why there are always false assumptions about this dark matter. To the annoyance of many customers when in the end the insurance company does not pay. Because transparency is important to us, we clear up the most common mistakes and hope that at least one or the other aha experience will evoke you.</strong></p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception # 1: The more insurances, the higher the protection.</u></strong></h3>



<p>No more protection, but definitely more costs. In order to only pay for the protection you really need, it is essential to look at the services of the various insurance policies that you have lying around at home. It is not uncommon for the same benefit to be insured twice or three times with different insurance companies. This is completely pointless, because in the event of a claim you only get the compensation once, even with several insurance companies.<br>For example, you should take the time to look through any credit cards with travel insurance, co-insurance with clubs or similar.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception # 2: Broken something? The liability insurance pays</u></strong> <strong><u>anyway.</u></strong></h3>



<p>In principle, liability insurance covers damage that is accidentally caused to a third party. However, it is not an all-round insurance policy that steps in for any awkwardness. Intentional or grossly negligent damage to borrowed items, in the case of favors (e.g. private relocation assistance), in the hotel room or when an item is currently in active use (damage to the activity) are excluded. What does it mean exactly? There is more information about the mistakes in liability insurance here .</p>



<p>In addition, it is often forgotten that liability insurance only pays if the insured is at fault and, as the name suggests, is liable for the damage. In the case of deliberate damage, no insurance will help.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception No. 3: Children and the matter of liability.</u></strong></h3>



<p>In Austria, parents are liable for their children under the age of 14 in the event of culpable violation of their duty of supervision (e.g. if children play with bows and arrows without warning to be careful). Exceptionally, however, under-14-year-olds can also be called upon if they can already admit their guilt and the child can bear the damage more easily than the injured party, for example because they have assets themselves. The assets also include liability insurance for the parents, which usually includes underage children living in the same household. What many do not know, however, is that claims for damages against close relatives who do not live in the same household are often not insured. These include grandparents, in-laws or step-parents.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception No. 4: Accident insurance covers all accidents.</u></strong></h3>



<p>It would be nice. Accident insurance only pays if the definition of an accident is met. That is, if you suffer permanent injury from a sudden and externally acting event. It does not pay for sheer clumsiness or reckless activities where common sense suggests a bad end. You should also know that the statutory accident insurance (UV) only covers accidents that occur in the course of work or on the way there. For accidents in your leisure time, which incidentally make up ¾ of all accidents, you have to take out private accident insurance take care of yourself. In addition, in the event of a loss of work, the statutory protection only replaces part of the income, the private insurance usually also includes the payment of daily allowances and an additional accident pension.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Mistake No. 5: With the E-Card you are also insured abroad.</u></strong></h3>



<p>No, the e-card is not valid everywhere , but only in EU member states, EEA states as well as in Switzerland, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In addition, the e-card is only valid at contract doctors or in public hospitals. To protect yourself from high costs in the event of illness, you need your own international health insurance. This is often also available in combination with a credit card (here a credit card insurance comparison ).</p>



<h3><strong><u>Error No. 6: The insurance is valid immediately after the conclusion of the contract.</u></strong></h3>



<p>Insurance companies often have a lead time before benefits can be claimed. This is often the case with legal protection insurance or supplementary health insurance. The reason is that the insurance does not want to pay for damage that already existed before the contract was signed. That’s only logical. As a consumer, however, you only have the option to wait for the lead time or to find insurance without a lead time.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Mistake no. 7: The fully comprehensive vehicle insurance pays for every damage to your own car.</u></strong></h3>



<p>Nope, unfortunately not. As with any other insurance, payment can be refused in the event of gross negligence. Anyway, with intent. If you overlook a stop sign or hold your cell phone in your hand while driving, you may run into problems with the insurance. Real street hooligans should consider insuring gross negligence against a higher premium.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Mistake no. 8: In the event of damage, I get the new price.</u></strong></h3>



<p>This only applies if replacement value replacement has been agreed with the insurance company. And in this case, too, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you can choose cool new things after a fire and the household insurance pays for it. The <strong>current replacement costs of</strong> the insured items in new condition or an equivalent item are reimbursed. The prerequisite for this is that you actually get the thing back. If you do not do that, you will only be reimbursed for the current value.</p>



<p>In addition, replacement value replacement is not possible with all insurance policies. In the case of liability insurance, for example, only the current value is replaced.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception No. 9: Household insurance pays in the event of theft.</u></strong></h3>



<p>Not correct. Household insurance usually only pays for burglary and robbery. Burglary means that the thief enters locked or locked premises without permission. On the other hand, robbery occurs when you are forced to remove your belongings at home using or threatening to use force. Trick theft, or simple theft, is not covered by most household insurances.<br>The same also applies to cell phone insurance, sports equipment or other property insurance with theft protection. There are insurance companies that insure simple theft, but the cover can be refused with reference to gross negligence if one does not keep a careful eye on the matter.</p>



<p>We are aware that with this article we are only providing a glimpse into the world of insurance and its errors. If there are other exceptions that you think should definitely be included in this article, then we look forward to your contributions and experiences in the comment. If you have questions, we are happy to help.</p>

<p><strong>There is probably no pet owner whose darling has not already done something at home. Broken dishes, half-eaten shoes or ruined floors &#8211; as much as we like them, the trouble can sometimes be. The situation is even more stupid if the four-legged friend causes damage to someone else &#8211; whether physically or purely materially. But is this actually covered by insurance, and if so, which one? We clarify.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Pet damage to furnishings and furnishings</strong></h3>



<p>If the cat uses the new leather couch as a scratching post or Wauwau favor is the new smartphone, you go in the <strong>household insurance</strong> , unfortunately, nothing. Damage caused by chewing, scratching, tearing or soiling are personal damage for which you are responsible and not an insured risk.</p>



<p>Now you might think, yes, well, but major damage is covered, such as a fire or an apartment flood caused by the pet . Unfortunately, no. Commercial household insurance covers risks such as improper leakage of water from pipes or sanitary facilities and the like. It depends on the realization of the insured risk. If the cat turns on the tap, that is not one of them.</p>



<p>With <strong>LAMIE Direkt Premium Household Insurance</strong> , such unusual damage is insured through the all-risk cover up to a sublimit of 25% of the sum insured.</p>



<h4><strong>Damage in the rented apartment</strong></h4>



<p>If you live in a rented apartment and the cat damages parts of the landlord&#8217;s building, for example the floor, the <strong>private liability</strong> insurance that is usually available does not jump into the breach either, because there is usually a so-called rental property damage and therefore a reason for exclusion.</p>



<h3><strong>Damage to third parties</strong></h3>



<p>If Carlo the cat does his business on the girlfriend&#8217;s expensive designer jacket, the <strong>personal liability</strong> insurance covers the damage. This covers damage to third parties caused by cats or other harmless (and non-toxic) small animals and is normally included in household insurance in Austria. Damage due to incorrect keeping or to animals for which an official permit is required (e.g. snakes), however, will not be accepted.</p>



<p>Damage caused by larger animals such as horses and dogs are not included in the personal liability insurance. If Bello goes for a passer-by while going for a walk, you have to <strong>answer</strong> for it if you don&#8217;t have your own <strong>dog liability insurance</strong> &#8211; which is already mandatory in Vienna, Upper Austria, Salzburg, Tyrol and Styria. In view of the recent incident in the media where a Rotweiler bit a child to death, we can recommend this pet owner liability to every dog ​​owner. For a premium of around € 40 per year you get a coverage of around € 3 million.</p>



<p><strong><u>Attention</u></strong> : If an accident occurs with an animal without a culpable violation of the duty of supervision, the insurance can refuse to cover damage with a high probability of success, e.g. if a dog injures the visitor&#8217;s dog while playing in its own garden.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="606" src="https://bridgebloging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/adult-1867665_12801-1024x606.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-44" srcset="https://bridgebloging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/adult-1867665_12801-1024x606.jpg 1024w, https://bridgebloging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/adult-1867665_12801-300x178.jpg 300w, https://bridgebloging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/adult-1867665_12801-768x455.jpg 768w, https://bridgebloging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/adult-1867665_12801-810x480.jpg 810w, https://bridgebloging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/adult-1867665_12801-1140x675.jpg 1140w, https://bridgebloging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/adult-1867665_12801.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>pixabay.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Climate change can now be felt all over the world. After last year, no one in Austria can deny that either. Everywhere you hear of floods, landslides, storms, earthquakes and other extreme weather conditions. But what if it suddenly hits you and your own home suffers great damage? Well, that&#8217;s why household insurance is one of the most important types of insurance. We provide a simple overview of which natural hazards &#8211; also called natural hazards in insurance jargon &#8211; are insured and which are not.</strong></p>



<p>If you yourself are affected, every natural event is a disaster and can endanger your existence. There are basically two different types of insurance that step in in the event of damage. Residential building insurance or homeowner insurance covers damage to the building itself and to insured outbuildings. Household insurance replaces items that have broken down due to natural hazards &#8211; in other words, all movable equipment such as furniture. So it depends first and foremost on where the damage occurs.</p>



<p>The second step is to check whether the cause &#8211; i.e. the danger itself &#8211; is insured at all. In the following we explain how events are defined by insurance companies and when insurance coverage is usually provided.</p>



<h2><strong>Natural hazards &#8211; elementary risks</strong></h2>



<p>&#8220;Damage caused by natural forces&#8221; is the collective term often used by insurance companies for damage caused by natural events.</p>



<h3><strong>Storm</strong></h3>



<p>If a storm sweeps away parts of the roof or ruins balcony furniture, the insurance pays from a certain wind force, usually over 59 km / h. When determining the wind speed, in case of doubt, the information from the  Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics  (ZAMG) is decisive.</p>



<h3><strong>lightning</strong></h3>



<p>Damage caused by lightning is usually covered by standard household insurance. However, a distinction is made between direct and indirect lightning strikes . If the lightning penetrates the ground and is distributed in the earth, this can lead to damage in electrical lines and devices even several kilometers away. In this case one speaks of indirect lightning strike. Check whether both options are also insured, as this is not always the case.</p>



<h3><strong>Hail, snow pressure and avalanches</strong></h3>



<p>Damage from hail and damage from roof avalanches or snow pressure are usually included in every common household and homeowner insurance. A roof avalanche is the term used to describe masses of snow falling from a roof. According to insurance dictionaries, snow pressure is naturally accumulated, dormant amounts of snow and ice.<br>Problems could arise when the snow melts, i.e. when the melted ice causes water damage. In this case there are some exceptions with the insurance companies. Document snow or hail damage as soon as possible and then remove the amount of snow immediately.<br>Damage caused by normal avalanches is not insured, but may be agreed separately under certain circumstances.</p>



<h3><strong>Rock fall, rock fall or landslide</strong></h3>



<p>In insurance jargon, rock fall, rockfall or landslide are defined quite similarly. The former two describe &#8220;the natural detachment and falling of <strong>rock masses</strong> in the terrain&#8221;, while landslides are called &#8220;deep downward movements of <strong>earth or rock masses &#8230;</strong> &#8221; and it usually occurs after heavy rainfall. All three events are usually included in a standard household and building insurance.</p>



<p><strong><u>Attention:</u></strong> The landslide must be distinguished from the mudslide, as this is often not insured! More on this below:</p>



<h2><strong>Natural disasters</strong></h2>



<p>Exceptional natural hazards are not automatically included in every household insurance. With some insurances, such damage can be insured &#8211; mostly under the term &#8220;disaster control&#8221;. This includes:</p>



<h3><strong>Debris flows</strong></h3>



<p>Many insurance policies exclude damage caused by mudslides. It is particularly important to distinguish it from a landslide because, as already mentioned, it is usually already insured. A debris flow has a more fluid character. It is a stream of mud, earth and stones. A landslide is a large mass of earth and rock that is detached from another layer of soil by larger amounts of water.</p>



<h3><strong>Flood</strong></h3>



<p>Insurance companies usually define floods as the leakage of water from a river, lake or other body of water. Flood damage is difficult and usually not sufficiently insurable. Measured against the insured material assets, the sublimits are usually low and the so-called accumulation loss limit must be taken into account. It is a kind of “pot” for the maximum amount that an insurance company is willing to pay for flood damage. In other words, all affected insured must split this amount in the worst-case scenario. In the worst case, you won&#8217;t even get the sublimit according to the contract.<br>Residential buildings in particularly flood-prone areas are usually not covered at all.</p>



<h3><strong>Flood and backwater</strong></h3>



<p>Floods are usually equated with high water. However, insurance companies differentiate between these terms. In contrast to flooding, the flooding is not caused by a body of water, but occurs because extraordinary rainfall exceeds the capacity of the local sewer system (sewer backwater) and / or the amounts of rain simply cannot run off anywhere.</p>



<p>So if water comes into the basement due to continuous rain and there is a sewer backlog, the household or building insurance will only compensate the damage if floods are also insured through extended coverage.</p>

<p><strong>Leaked washing machine, a clogged drain or an insect invasion &#8211; every now and then damage happens in your own home that is very annoying in everyday life and causes considerable inconvenience. And then often even at a time when you really don&#8217;t need it. Usually, however, this damage can be prevented, prevented or eliminated with simple means. We have summarized the most important tips for you. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3><strong>1. Avoid mold</strong></h3>



<p>Mold in the home not only looks ugly, it is also terribly unhealthy. Bad ventilation, hanging up laundry in the apartment or previous water damage causes the black film of dirt to form very quickly, especially in the joints of the window, in the corners of the wall and in the bathroom. Contact your landlord or have a professional check it out.</p>



<p><br>Correct ventilation is essential here. A high level of humidity and cold walls can support the formation of mold. Make sure that the air is exchanged as quickly as possible by ventilating the room with the windows wide open. When the windows are tilted, however, only little fresh air comes in and at the same time the walls cool down considerably.<br>If you keep the air nice and dry and mold formation occurs despite adequate ventilation, it is probably due to the condition of the house.<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://versicherungsblog.lamie-direkt.at/schaden-mietwohnung-aufgaben-vermieter&amp;usg=ALkJrhhsWUc8S3hIUPoT-UjBIZB1NyB6Gw" target="_blank"></a></p>



<p><strong>LAMIE insurance tip:</strong> Mold growth is not covered by household <strong>insurance</strong> , unless it is the result of insured tap water damage (then counts as consequential damage and is usually paid for).</p>



<h3><strong>2. Do not leave the washing machine or dishwasher running unattended</strong></h3>



<p>A common everyday situation: before leaving the apartment, quickly switch on the washing machine and then hang up the laundry in the evening. That saves time and is practical.</p>



<p>But the fact is, should a hose burst or the good device somehow fail, the apartment may be under water in no time. If you are not at home when that happens, you cannot react immediately and contain or even prevent the water damage.</p>



<p>Another disadvantage: For many insurance companies there is an obligation to supervise (despite the Aqua-Stop function) so that the damage is paid if the worst comes to the worst. Failure to do this is often classified as grossly negligent and the service can be refused.</p>



<p><strong>LAMIE insurance tip:</strong> There is the possibility of insuring “gross negligence” in the household insurance.</p>



<h4><strong>Our tips for the dishwasher and washing machine:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Never leave it unattended</li><li>After finishing the washing process, block the water supply (better safe than sorry)</li><li>Check the tap, hose and seals regularly and replace them in good time</li><li>If the water runs out while washing, turn off the tap immediately and wipe up the liquid.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>3. Protect electrical devices from overvoltage</strong></h3>



<p>If there is a lightning strike near your home during a thunderstorm, an overvoltage can occur in the power grid, which in turn can damage electrical devices or cables. The simplest way to protect your devices from overvoltage is simple but effective: Unplug all electronic devices as soon as the thunderstorm begins. Because this is not always easy to implement in practice &#8211; for example when your favorite series is running &#8211; you can also protect your devices with special surge plugs. You can find them in every electronics store.</p>



<p><strong>LAMIE insurance tip:</strong> While direct lightning strikes are covered in common household <strong>insurance</strong> , this is not necessarily the case with indirect lightning strikes. However, insurance companies offer additional packages to also insure indirect lightning strikes. The LAMIE Premium home and household insurance also insures   indirect lightning strikes!</p>



<h3><strong>4. Clogged drain</strong></h3>



<p>If toilets and drains are increasingly misused as garbage chutes, sooner or later they will become clogged. Here we appeal to the cozy bastard who lives in us all and makes us dispose of the leftovers from dinner quickly in the toilet. Other foreign bodies that are often improperly disposed of via the toilet and drain are cat litter, feminine hygiene articles, edible fat, cotton swabs, hygiene towels and edible fat. And there is also a small, practical sieve for hair closing.<br>So do yourself and the environment a favor and throw these things in the trash. Poisonous pipe cleaners goodbye!</p>



<p><br>Typically, clogging is not covered by your home insurance. As the owner of an apartment or house, you can take out building insurance for this. If you are a tenant, ask your landlord whether clogging is covered by his building insurance.</p>



<h3><strong>5. Scratches in the floor</strong></h3>



<p>Slight scratches and discoloration on the beautiful parquet are annoying, but do not have to be repaired by the tenant when moving out, as these are signs of wear and tear. Such marks can be repaired with simple household remedies or repair kits from the hardware store.</p>



<h3><strong>6. Damage to the induction cooker or ceramic hob</strong></h3>



<p>You probably know that too: For a moment, not paying attention and the milk has boiled over and an unpleasant smelling brown crust burns nicely into the stove that has just been cleaned. Depending on how quickly you react, the stain is more or less difficult to remove. An absolute no-go for the sensitive hob are scouring milk, metal sponges or any sharp objects. If the burned-in does not want to go away with common cleaning agents, then there are special cleaners and a special ceramic hob scraper.</p>



<p><br><strong>LAMIE insurance tip: make</strong> sure that <strong>you include</strong> glass ceramic and induction <strong>hobs</strong> in your household insurance.</p>



<h3><strong>7. Vermin</strong></h3>



<p>Fruit mosquitoes, mites, moths and the absolute horror: cockroaches in your own apartment &#8211; if you find something like that in your own four walls, you don&#8217;t really enjoy coming home at first. In addition, it is usually quite a torture to get rid of these critters again. Some make their way into food, others ruin clothes or other textiles. Some also transmit diseases.</p>



<p>But what can you do about it? Simply vacuum up with a vacuum cleaner? Unfortunately, it is usually not that easy or it depends of course on the strength of the infestation. While you can get rid of food moths and flies quite easily by disposing of the infested food and cleaning everything nicely, you can only get rid of other critters with special means. In addition, Dr. Google against silver fish, dust mites &amp; Co various household remedies.</p>



<p>But you should definitely leave the fight against bedbugs, cockroaches and cockroaches to the professional, because they usually live well hidden and in large groups.</p>



<p>In the event of severe pest infestation, you should report this to the landlord immediately. If the apartment is so badly infested through no fault of the tenant that it is unsuitable for use, the tenancy can even be terminated prematurely.</p>



<h3><strong>8. Prevent heating failure and have the thermal bath serviced</strong></h3>



<p>Basically: If you cannot use the apartment or only to a limited extent due to the maintenance work not being carried out by the landlord, the tenant has the right to a rent reduction. Above all, this includes a defective heating system.</p>



<p></p>



<p><br>Since the 2015 amendment to the right of residence, the landlord has to have defective heating boilers, electric boilers or other heat preparation devices repaired or replaced if they are part of the basic equipment of the apartment according to the rental agreement. However, maintenance is the responsibility of the tenant. So it is best to check straight away when the last routine check took place. A check not only reduces damage, but can also be of vital importance and is even required by law. Usually, energy providers inform landlords when the inspection is due.</p>

<p><strong>In times of digitization and ever better smart home technology, the private space is becoming the subject of the Internet. Sometimes very intimate data is saved to make everyday life as easy as possible. The technology-loving resident enjoys not having to pull out the key to open the front door, but simply holding out his face or finger. What a relief it is! As fancy as these everyday conveniences are, they are not necessarily safer. Hackers who specialize in system security tests have proven several times that operating some door opener systems only requires mediocre programming skills. That cybercrime will eventually replace the analog crime business,confirm the daily reports already. For this reason, you should also devote yourself to security and not blindly follow some technology trends. Because this could possibly lead to problems with the insurance. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Smart home has nothing to do with burglary protection</strong></h3>



<p>Smart home applications link all smart devices via their own base station in the household and enable convenient control via mobile phone or manufacturer app. In addition to saving energy through smart thermostats and lighting control, the focus here is above all on smart security systems. This is intended to alert smart home owners via motion detectors via open windows, uninvited guests and much more. In order to offer updates and to make the house “accessible” while on the move, these systems are of course connected to the Internet. However, this is exactly where the problem lies.</p>



<p>Every year, hundreds of thousands of consumers in Austria are victims of cybercrime &#8211; this also includes break-ins into networked houses and apartments. All devices that can be controlled via the network can also be controlled by someone else. This opens new gates for hackers and modern intruders. Stiftung Warentest has already tested smart home systems with security functions and the conclusion is: “Weak against burglars. None of the systems tested scored very good or good ”.</p>



<p>The European umbrella association &#8220;Insurance Europe&#8221; (IE) warns above all about typical weak points such as:</p>



<ul><li>1-factor authentication: The best-known example of this is that many applications in a system can be accessed with just one password.</li><li>Unencrypted transmission of video data</li><li>No restrictions on entering incorrect access data</li><li>Insecure application interfaces and apps</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Why insurance companies usually drop out in the event of a cyber break-in</strong></h3>



<p>In insurance, this is a hot topic in everyday claims &#8211; for example, a hacked entrance gate in most cases shows no signs of burglary. Such traces are mostly necessary according to the insurance conditions of building and household insurances. A hacker theft can be compared to a bicycle theft. This is often rejected by insurance companies because the thief himself &#8220;stole or took the lock with him&#8221; and there are therefore no direct signs of a break-in. Even if the customer should have a photo of the key to the bicycle lock or something similar, this is almost always doomed to failure. Because in retrospect it is not possible to check whether the bike was actually locked at the time of the crime. Wasn&#8217;t it lockeda simple theft that is usually not insured has occurred and the insurance cover does not apply.</p>



<p>It is the same with a smart home hack or car key hack, because it is difficult to prove it. The possibility that the policyholder simply did not lock the entrance door or the car at the time of the crime remains here. This means that it is usually not possible to cover the damage without evidence.</p>



<p>Of course there are household insurances that cover simple theft, but this is usually very limited. If there are no physical traces of a breach, it will be necessary to call in experts such as digital forensic experts for clarification and to allow the insurer to read out data. The Austrian market is still in its infancy when it comes to own smart home insurances and additional packages &#8211; which protect against damage caused by hacked home applications.</p>



<p>Smart home systems without adequate mechanical burglar protection and professional security technology (alarm system etc.) are therefore currently not recommended. Do-it-yourself installation of smart home technology, i.e. without the assistance of a specialist, is also not advisable.</p>



<h3><strong>Privacy nightmare</strong></h3>



<p>The comforts of the smart home have another downer. Namely the disclosure of sensitive data, not only to the providers of the system, but also to possible data thieves. On the one hand, internet giants like Amazon can constantly listen in and watch through their voice assistants and thus “improve” their offerings. On the other hand, you never know when the next data scandal will occur and countless users run the risk of losing a lot of money.</p>

<p><strong>Water damage is one of the most common and annoying types of damage in residential buildings. </strong><strong>In addition to the </strong><strong>usually </strong><strong>laborious and long-lasting clarification and repair, there is </strong><strong>often</strong> <strong>a dispute: Who has to pay for the water damage? The landlord or the tenant? </strong><strong>Whose insurance covers the damage? </strong><strong>We have clear answers for you.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>This </strong><strong>water damage is the responsibility of the landlord</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The landlord has to basically to all those water damage in and around the building worry that by <strong>damage to water pipes</strong> emerge. According to the general provisions of the Civil Code the maintenance obligation may the apartment are indeed agreed-free, but the Tenancy Act (MRG) is the rental agreement is fully applied, shall take the landlord at any rate the maintenance obligation de r apartment and must he ensure that the apartment also habitable is. Related t also the elimination of moisture damage to walls, ceilings or floors by Rohrbruc h. Damage to inflow and outflow pipes in the masonry is also the responsibility of the property management. </p>



<p>It is important that any damage that needs to be repaired (notifiable!) Is reported to the landlord or property management company as soon as possible. Do not undertake repairs on your own unless there is imminent danger. Only in this case can you demand reimbursement of costs from the landlord.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Water damage a n building components , such as at floor n , tile, wallpaper, wall covering s, existing n built-in furniture, etc. may in the landlord <strong>building insurance</strong> report .&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The </strong><strong>renter is responsible </strong><strong>for this damage</strong><strong></strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The tenant-like n for all damage to the building and to own furniture, which <strong>are by their own devices or systems</strong> , such as when a ruptured hose of the dishwasher in the kitchen leads to a flood. For tap water amage the mobile home content comes the <strong>household insurance</strong> the renter on &#8211; even if, as mentioned above, the cause of damage to the building is located and must be eliminated by the landlord. In some cases , building accessories and components such as paintings, wallpaper, tiles, floor coverings, wall and ceiling coverings are also covered by household insurance. However, you usually have to insure this separately.Does the water discharge from one of your devices to damage in the apartment of your neighbors, then the neighbor is your liability insurance to cover any claims for damages on .&nbsp;</p>



<p>There can also be a problem with built-in bathrooms or built-in furniture and kitchens. Namely, if these were purchased and installed by the tenant himself , but are not counted as movable property in the household insurance according to the insurance conditions. Insurance coverage in the event of water damage can be a matter of dispute here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lamie Tip</strong> : We recommend you , to confirm your insurer to make sure your built-in furniture and kitchen are insured as household contents , or that this very included in the insurance coverage are . In the Lamie household insurance is between no distinction built-in furniture and moving furniture in kitchen and bathroom. Both are equally insured. <br></p>



<h3><strong>Maintenance obligation violated</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Just as the owner or the owners&#8217; association in principle the maintenance of the entire building and the landlord the preservation of the apartment is up, hit the tenant certain maintenance duties inside the home. The tenant is therefore liable for damage that has occurred because he has not complied with this maintenance obligation (e.g. servicing water pipes, decalcifying fittings, cleaning siphons and venting radiators .However, whether the renewal of brittle silicone joints is part of the tenant&#8217;s maintenance obligation depends on the type of tenancy. In old buildings (building permit before 1945), the renovation generally affects the tenant. In newer buildings, it is necessary to review the rental agreement, as these may contain regulations on maintenance work. If the agreements in the rental contract lead to the transfer of obligations to the tenant in individual cases, these are in any case void. 3 In cooperative housing, the non-profit building association is obliged to renew the joints.<br>As mentioned above, damage to furniture that occurs in this way is covered by household insurance. The repair of the systems can become a controversial issue here, namely if the landlord refuses to commission his building insurance. 5 Here it may be , the s must pay the tenant the damage out of pocket. Can you think of shortcomings, d ng remedy under the responsibility of the landlord f like everything , so you need to show him this without delay. If the landlord then remains inactive and tap water damage occurs due to his failure to actyou may have the right to a rent reduction and claims for damages for any damage to your household effects.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>fault</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Of course, the tenant also has to pay for any water damage that was caused by his fault. For example, if he leaves the washing machine unattended or clogs the pipes himself by disposing of waste. 6 In the case of such damage, it should be remembered that household insurance (movable property) only takes over if gross negligence is also insured.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of who is to blame or responsible, in any case you should react quickly to water damage and reduce the damage as much as possible (e.g. turn off the main water tap, suck up spilled water or call the fire brigade if it spreads quickly). It&#8217;s also a good idea to capture the damage in photos. You can read about what to do in the event of water damage in our practical checklist . </p>

<p><strong>A great feeling: Summer is here and you can finally get your beloved bike out of hibernation. However, especially in the warm season, it is not exactly safe for your bike outside. Bicycles are constantly changing hands without permission &#8211; 20,805 bicycles were stolen in Austria in 2019, according to VCÖ. But how can you adequately insure your bike and what does household insurance cover? LAMIE enlightened!</strong></p>



<p>Bicycle thieves are not only out and about in public places, but also in residential complexes. The household insurance usually provides good basic protection against bicycle theft in their own home. In principle, however, insurance cover only exists if your bike is either locked or locked. This means that it &#8220;must&#8221; be stolen in the following way, so to speak:</p>



<ul><li>if you break into your apartment or a locked cellar, or</li><li>in the event of theft from a general part of the building (bicycle cellar, attic, corridor, garden), if it was previously secured with a lock.</li></ul>



<p>It is clear to many that the bike has to be locked in some way and it goes without saying anyway. What is unfortunately not so clear as day: The insurance coverage of your bicycle from the household insurance ends at the property line!</p>



<h2>Bicycle theft &#8211; WHEN and WHERE does household insurance get out?</h2>



<p>There is no insurance cover:</p>



<ul><li>in the event of bicycle theft outside the insured property (applies to the street in front of the house)</li><li>in the event of theft of unlocked bicycles from communal areas (such as attics, cellars, storage rooms, staircases)</li><li>mostly in the case of partial theft, i.e. if only parts of the bike are stolen (saddle, handlebars, accessories, and the like)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Danger! </strong>The compensation from household insurance in the event of bicycle theft is relatively low at an average of € 1,500 per claim. In the case of expensive bicycles or e-bikes, separate bicycle insurance could be worthwhile. More on this below.</p>



<p><img src="https://www.lamie-direkt.at/documents/10184/0/LAMIE-TIPP.png/ed5a1b51-7b6b-44c7-9fc6-79a7f365cadb?t=1463650527300" alt="">&nbsp;Take precautions with appropriate documentation! Invoice receipts and photos facilitate the processing in the event of a claim.</p>



<h2>A separate bicycle insurance for high-quality bicycles and e-bikes </h2>



<p>If, however, you travel a lot by bike and most of the time it is cordoned off in other places, you should consider getting your own bike theft insurance. The range of services is more extensive than household insurance and usually also includes partial theft and vandalism. For e-bikes there is even comprehensive fully and partially comprehensive insurance, which also includes natural hazards, fire and accidents.<br>The sports equipment should really be worth such an insurance. Because the premiums are usually relatively expensive and deductibles or annual discounts are to be expected. Usually only new bicycles can be insured. Some insurers require a certain minimum value of the bicycle lock, as well as the registration of the bicycle.</p>



<h2>Protective measures: How to protect your bike from thieves</h2>



<ul><li>Under no circumstances should you save on the bike lock!</li><li>Use fixed barriers / railings (under no circumstances attach the bike lock only between the frame and the tire)</li><li>Lock the bike directly on the frame! (The wheel can be easily removed)</li><li>Use safety screws (saddle and front wheel are often only fitted with a quick release)</li><li>Park your bike in busy places</li><li>Register your bike <a href="http://www.fase24.com/">http://www.fase24.com/</a></li></ul>

<p><strong>A break-in in your own apartment &#8211; a horrific idea. You come home from work and the door is open. Inside there is a lot of chaos and you quickly realize: I was broken into! The first question that comes up often afterwards: Does my household insurance pay? LAMIE has summarized the most important requirements for you.</strong></p>



<p>The danger of falling victim to a burglary is omnipresent. According to the Federal Criminal Police Office, around 25 break-ins occur every day in Austria. In these cases, those affected naturally hope for help from household insurance. In order for this to compensate for the damage, however, the following requirements must be met:</p>



<h2>Condition 1: There must be burglary or robbery</h2>



<p>If your belongings are stolen from your own four walls, the HOW is the most important thing when it comes to household insurance. Usually only burglary and robbery are insured.</p>



<p>Burglary means that the thief breaks into locked or locked rooms. As follows:</p>



<ul><li>by breaking open doors, windows or other parts of the building</li><li>by entering through openings that are not intended for entry (by overcoming significant obstacles)</li><li>by breaking locks with tools or the wrong key</li><li>with correct keys that were obtained through burglary in other than the insured premises or through the use or threat of violence</li></ul>

If the burglar breaks in to get the key, the items stolen from the apartment are not insured.</p>



<p>Damage caused by vandalism after a break-in is usually not covered, but can be included as an additional module.</p>



<p>On the other hand, robbery occurs when you are forced to pull out your belongings at home by using or threatening to use force &#8211; and without a break-in. This is the case, for example, if you are forced to open the entrance door.</p>



<h2>Requirement 2: There must be no simple theft</h2>



<p>The most common exclusion from insurance is simple theft . This is the case if the thief had unhindered access to your personal belongings. So there is usually no cover if you leave your apartment unattended &#8211; even if only for a short time &#8211; with the windows, balcony or doors open. The so-called creeping theft is also usually not insured. A sneak thief is someone who sneaks into the apartment unnoticed and sneaks out or breaks out again unnoticed.</p>



<p><strong><u>Don&#8217;t forget:</u></strong> If there is no insurance cover for simple theft at home, then there is none outside your own four walls. (e.g. if your bag is simply torn away in the supermarket or in the café)</p>



<p><img src="https://www.lamie-direkt.at/documents/10184/0/LAMIE-TIPP.png/ed5a1b51-7b6b-44c7-9fc6-79a7f365cadb?t=1463650527300" alt=""> In some cases there are insurance companies that also insure simple or creeping theft. However, you shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the insurer refuses cover on the grounds of gross negligence. Insurance against simple theft &#8211; sounds good, but usually doesn&#8217;t help!</p>



<h2>Requirement 3: It is not allowed to act “grossly negligent”</h2>



<p>One of the most popular reasons for rejection from insurance companies is the subject of “gross negligence”. According to the general definition, someone acts with gross negligence if he neglects the required degree of care! This statement alone is likely to provide material for hours of discussion. According to our experts, however, the following are particularly critical when it comes to burglary:</p>



<ul><li>The door only snaps into place when leaving the apartment (if all residents leave the apartment, the apartment door must be locked with the key in any case. It is not enough to just close a door with a knob on the outside).</li><li>Tilted windows on the first floor</li><li>Outdoor climbing aids</li><li>Hiding keys outside the building (e.g. under the doormat)</li></ul>



<p><strong>&nbsp;Tip:</strong> Pay attention to the inclusion of gross negligence in your insurance cover.</p>



<h2>Requirement 4: Valuables must be kept in the safe</h2>



<p>Household insurance usually covers everyday objects. Valuables such as cash, savings books, jewelry, etc. are also insured in the event of a break-in, but the benefits are often linked to certain conditions. For example, some insurance companies only replace valuables if they have been kept in a safe. In addition, the maximum values ​​that can be kept in a safe depend on certain security classes. Wall safes must also be walled in according to regulations.</p>



<p><strong>Warning:</strong> do not use a key safe! Some insurance companies have special regulations on how and where the key must be kept. In the case of safekeeping within the insurance premises, it is prescribed, for example, that the key must be stored in an equally secure container as the safe itself. Translated, this would mean that you need your own safe just for the safe key. A safe with mechanical or electronic locking saves you from worrying.</p>



<p>In addition, there are usually certain maximum compensation limits (sublimits) for exposed and locked valuables. At best, you can increase this by adding a premium.</p>



<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Document your valuables and belongings well and keep the bills. Also save an electronic copy of it externally (in case your computer is stolen). This facilitates the processing in the event of damage immensely.</p>



<h2>Prerequisite 5: Police report and forensic evidence are a MUST</h2>



<p>If you become the victim of a break-in or robbery, report it to the police immediately (but no longer than 48 hours). This then carries out forensic evidence on site. The insurer can then use the police report to understand what happened.</p>



<p>If the report is filed late, it could be that traces are obliterated or destroyed and the police can no longer determine the cause and the cause of the damage. In such a case, the insurance may refuse to pay.</p>



<p><strong>Do not forget:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Locks can only be exchanged, windows repaired and chairs set up again after they have been reported. However, this no-trace-blurring rule does not apply if damage caused by the burglar can still be reduced. So if you have a fire or the bathroom has been flooded, you are subject to the so-called damage mitigation obligation.</li><li>Notify your insurer too! This also wants to be informed immediately and comprehensively about the claim. Late reporting of a claim can also lead to the insurer being exempt from providing benefits.</li></ul>



<h2>Requirement 6: Reported safety devices such as alarm systems must be activated</h2>



<p>Insurance companies usually grant low premium discounts for reported alarm systems or security doors. All well and good, but can be expensive in the event of damage. If, for example, the alarm system is deactivated during a break-in, insurance cover is no longer applicable. So make sure that all additionally agreed security measures are observed.</p>
