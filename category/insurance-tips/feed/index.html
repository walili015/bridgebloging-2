<p><strong>Insurance is not sexy, but it is still necessary to protect yourself against certain risks in life. So you have to deal with this rather dry matter now and then for better or worse. Most of them only do the bare minimum, look for the best price or let the trusted broker put together a nice package. But that is also the reason why there are always false assumptions about this dark matter. To the annoyance of many customers when in the end the insurance company does not pay. Because transparency is important to us, we clear up the most common mistakes and hope that at least one or the other aha experience will evoke you.</strong></p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception # 1: The more insurances, the higher the protection.</u></strong></h3>



<p>No more protection, but definitely more costs. In order to only pay for the protection you really need, it is essential to look at the services of the various insurance policies that you have lying around at home. It is not uncommon for the same benefit to be insured twice or three times with different insurance companies. This is completely pointless, because in the event of a claim you only get the compensation once, even with several insurance companies.<br>For example, you should take the time to look through any credit cards with travel insurance, co-insurance with clubs or similar.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception # 2: Broken something? The liability insurance pays</u></strong> <strong><u>anyway.</u></strong></h3>



<p>In principle, liability insurance covers damage that is accidentally caused to a third party. However, it is not an all-round insurance policy that steps in for any awkwardness. Intentional or grossly negligent damage to borrowed items, in the case of favors (e.g. private relocation assistance), in the hotel room or when an item is currently in active use (damage to the activity) are excluded. What does it mean exactly? There is more information about the mistakes in liability insurance here .</p>



<p>In addition, it is often forgotten that liability insurance only pays if the insured is at fault and, as the name suggests, is liable for the damage. In the case of deliberate damage, no insurance will help.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception No. 3: Children and the matter of liability.</u></strong></h3>



<p>In Austria, parents are liable for their children under the age of 14 in the event of culpable violation of their duty of supervision (e.g. if children play with bows and arrows without warning to be careful). Exceptionally, however, under-14-year-olds can also be called upon if they can already admit their guilt and the child can bear the damage more easily than the injured party, for example because they have assets themselves. The assets also include liability insurance for the parents, which usually includes underage children living in the same household. What many do not know, however, is that claims for damages against close relatives who do not live in the same household are often not insured. These include grandparents, in-laws or step-parents.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception No. 4: Accident insurance covers all accidents.</u></strong></h3>



<p>It would be nice. Accident insurance only pays if the definition of an accident is met. That is, if you suffer permanent injury from a sudden and externally acting event. It does not pay for sheer clumsiness or reckless activities where common sense suggests a bad end. You should also know that the statutory accident insurance (UV) only covers accidents that occur in the course of work or on the way there. For accidents in your leisure time, which incidentally make up ¾ of all accidents, you have to take out private accident insurance take care of yourself. In addition, in the event of a loss of work, the statutory protection only replaces part of the income, the private insurance usually also includes the payment of daily allowances and an additional accident pension.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Mistake No. 5: With the E-Card you are also insured abroad.</u></strong></h3>



<p>No, the e-card is not valid everywhere , but only in EU member states, EEA states as well as in Switzerland, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In addition, the e-card is only valid at contract doctors or in public hospitals. To protect yourself from high costs in the event of illness, you need your own international health insurance. This is often also available in combination with a credit card (here a credit card insurance comparison ).</p>



<h3><strong><u>Error No. 6: The insurance is valid immediately after the conclusion of the contract.</u></strong></h3>



<p>Insurance companies often have a lead time before benefits can be claimed. This is often the case with legal protection insurance or supplementary health insurance. The reason is that the insurance does not want to pay for damage that already existed before the contract was signed. That’s only logical. As a consumer, however, you only have the option to wait for the lead time or to find insurance without a lead time.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Mistake no. 7: The fully comprehensive vehicle insurance pays for every damage to your own car.</u></strong></h3>



<p>Nope, unfortunately not. As with any other insurance, payment can be refused in the event of gross negligence. Anyway, with intent. If you overlook a stop sign or hold your cell phone in your hand while driving, you may run into problems with the insurance. Real street hooligans should consider insuring gross negligence against a higher premium.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Mistake no. 8: In the event of damage, I get the new price.</u></strong></h3>



<p>This only applies if replacement value replacement has been agreed with the insurance company. And in this case, too, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you can choose cool new things after a fire and the household insurance pays for it. The <strong>current replacement costs of</strong> the insured items in new condition or an equivalent item are reimbursed. The prerequisite for this is that you actually get the thing back. If you do not do that, you will only be reimbursed for the current value.</p>



<p>In addition, replacement value replacement is not possible with all insurance policies. In the case of liability insurance, for example, only the current value is replaced.</p>



<h3><strong><u>Misconception No. 9: Household insurance pays in the event of theft.</u></strong></h3>



<p>Not correct. Household insurance usually only pays for burglary and robbery. Burglary means that the thief enters locked or locked premises without permission. On the other hand, robbery occurs when you are forced to remove your belongings at home using or threatening to use force. Trick theft, or simple theft, is not covered by most household insurances.<br>The same also applies to cell phone insurance, sports equipment or other property insurance with theft protection. There are insurance companies that insure simple theft, but the cover can be refused with reference to gross negligence if one does not keep a careful eye on the matter.</p>

If there are other exceptions that you think should definitely be included in this article, then we look forward to your contributions and experiences in the comment.

<p><strong>Land of mountains, land on the river, land of bureaucracy. Starting a business in Austria is an excursion into the jungle of uncertainty. Often this overlooks the need to adequately insure yourself or the company. This can be a fatal mistake if, for example, unexpected events turn the dream of a startup and self-employed money into a nightmare. To avoid this risk, we have summarized five tips for you on the subject of insurance for startups.</strong></p>



<h3><strong>1. Think about insurance: an often forgotten step in self-employment</strong></h3>



<p>It may surprise one or the other, but many entrepreneurs do not even think about insurance for the company for the time being. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, ignorance, because very few are aware of what insurance there is for entrepreneurs and which one is needed. On the other hand, many do not even think about it during their career as founders because they are completely absorbed by other problems or tasks. Especially in the start-up phase, an entrepreneur looks at financing and customer growth. Is understandable. But you should also consider which risks could hit you particularly hard at the beginning.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Analyze industry-specific risks &#8211; which insurance makes sense?</strong></h3>



<p>In order to weigh up from the outset which type of insurance would be suitable, it is essential to carry out a short risk analysis. It is a good idea to categorize your industry-specific risks into low, medium, and high risks. Each industry therefore also needs different insurance. Disaster risks that would mean the end of the company should be hedged first and foremost. In the case of transport companies , the transport should therefore be insured with good transport liability and public liability insurance, in the event that, for example, large quantities of goods are employed. A professional liability insurance would be analogous to this<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://www.iib.at/berufshaftpflichtversicherung&amp;usg=ALkJrhjuAeEY0qNj779UKaPKwy2IFtE_Xg" target="_blank"></a>makes sense for an IT company because programming errors, for example, can quickly cause major damage. If high investments have been made in plant and equipment, these should be covered with tailor-made property insurance including business interruption.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Industry-independent risk &#8211; cyber crime</strong></h3>



<p>While risks are largely industry-specific, there are some hazards that apply to most industries. The most rapidly growing threat can be found in the IT sector. Cunning cyber attacks can quickly paralyze entire websites or result in complete data loss. For a young startup, this quickly means financial ruin if the trust that has been so painstakingly built up is lost with the first important customers. In addition to investing in cyber security in good time, proper password protection and educating employees against social engineering attacks, you should also take out cyber insurance.<br><strong>Tip</strong> : The GDV offers a  cyber security check with which you can assess how good the IT security of your company is.<br> <br><br> </p>



<h3><strong>4. General insurance for startups</strong></h3>



<p>The following is a brief overview of the most important general insurances in the start-up area:</p>



<h4><strong>Public liability insurance</strong></h4>



<p>This is the corporate counterpart to personal liability insurance. As a result, the company and the associated employees are insured when carrying out their operational activities if third-party property or persons are negligently damaged. This means that claims for damages are checked first and if there is a justified claim for damages, the damage will be settled by this insurance to the extent of the coverage. Business liability insurance is particularly useful for companies with several employees. Typically, such incidents often happen in skilled trades, where errors occur in the work process and these subsequently affect the customer.</p>



<h4><strong>Professional Liability Insurance</strong></h4>



<p>This is an industry-specific insurance that is relevant for many self-employed and also freelancers. This is especially true for industries with serious consequential errors. In addition, there are also professionals who complete by law to hold professional indemnity insurance must . Professional liability insurance usually differs from public liability insurance in terms of the insurance coverage. As a rule, it covers pure financial loss, with public liability aimed at personal injury and property damage. The professional groups mentioned above include, for example, tax consultants, lawyers and architects. This type of insurance is also highly recommended for startups with risky errors, such as in the IT industry.</p>



<h4><strong>D&amp;O insurance</strong></h4>



<p>Key persons should also be protected accordingly, because they usually run a very high risk. Managing directors and managers are liable to the company for culpably committed breaches of duty with their private assets. If one acts negligently as a managing director and thereby falls into the liability of the managing director, it can in some cases lead to bankruptcy. Directors and officers insurance protects the private assets of the manager and the assets of the executives.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Company legal protection insurance</strong></h4>



<p>Professional liability insurance already covers passive legal protection, while corporate legal protection takes on active legal protection. In the event of a lawsuit, the company legal protection insurance will cover the legal costs, which include court and lawyer fees.</p>



<p>In order to find an insurance tailored to your own needs, an advisor can be useful to explain possible options. The Integral Insurance Broker GmbH will be happy to help and advice.</p>



<h3><strong>5. Company pension schemes and private pension insurance</strong></h3>



<p>As a founder of a startup, you actually live the progress of the future. The only thing that is often not considered is getting older, although founders also have an enormous amount of personal responsibility here.</p>



<p>In Austria there are statutory, private and company pension schemes. The latter is only available for employees, which is why the self-employed usually have to make provisions with a high private share. Options for this are long-term investments in real estate or stocks, traditionally saving money for old age or investing in good private pension insurance. As part of the pension commitment, you can convert business assets into private assets for indispensable workers or for the company owner himself, by investing in pension provision insurance.</p>



<p>But pension funds or company group insurance are also a good measure in terms of personnel policy for employees of start-ups. The additional financial and solid provision for the future is an incentive for many young people. Which is important considering the fact that small, young companies often have a competitive disadvantage when it comes to pay. When investing in a company pension scheme, the premium payments are not only exempt from social security contributions and other ancillary wage costs, but are also deductible as business expenses.</p>

<p><strong>People invest a lot of time and money in many a hobby or passion. Sports equipment such as bicycles, skis, golf equipment or fishing equipment are of high material value and are therefore popular stolen goods. But you also want to have your beloved sports equipment covered against other damage, which is why sports equipment insurance is increasingly being offered when you buy it. But what exactly is insured and when do other insurances also protect? We&#8217;ll briefly clarify this for you.</strong></p>



<h3><strong>What does household insurance cover?</strong></h3>



<p>In the LAMIE household  insurance, sports equipment is insured against damage (fire, storm etc.) and burglary within the insured premises. For a burglary, however, the device must be inside the locked apartment or a locked cellar. If the sports equipment is parked in common areas (for example in the bike cellar, staircase or garden), it must be cordoned off accordingly. This means that the burglar or thief must demonstrably break something in order for the insurance to pay.<br><strong>Caution:</strong>For certain devices, insurance cover can also be restricted (sublimits). Motorized devices such as quards, golf carts and jetsky are usually excluded. So check your insurance conditions.<br> <br><br> </p>



<h3><strong>Damage to third parties</strong></h3>



<p>If someone else is harmed by an accident or carelessness while exercising with your own device, private liability insurance generally pays. This is usually included in the household insurance. However, this does not apply if, for example, you handle a friend&#8217;s sports equipment and damage it in the process. This is a so-called activity damage, which is usually excluded.</p>



<h3><strong>When is sports equipment insurance worthwhile?</strong></h3>



<p>Sports equipment insurance covers property damage and is a kind of comprehensive insurance, so to speak. Typical sports equipment insurances on the market are insurance for fishing equipment, bicycles, ski and snowboards, golf equipment, hunting and sporting weapons, and diving equipment. In particular, pay attention to whether theft or burglary is insured and what the requirements for benefits in the event of a claim are. In the case of device insurance policies that cover simple theft, it is often the case that the device will be rejected due to gross negligence if the device is not closely guarded at all times.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>To ensure that the device is insured against damage while on the move or when traveling, it should include transport insurance or the insurance cover should generally also be valid abroad.</p>



<p>Sports equipment insurance generally makes sense when investing in expensive sports equipment. Unfortunately, the price-performance ratio is often poor and repairs are cheaper. Here you shouldn&#8217;t conclude directly in the shop, but rather do the calculations again at home or compare different offers.</p>



<h3><strong>On vacation: sports equipment protected by travel insurance?</strong></h3>



<p>Whether sports equipment is covered in luggage insurance (often also included in credit card travel insurance) always depends on how &#8220;luggage&#8221; is defined there. According to most conditions, luggage includes things that are taken with you on trips for personal and private use for personal travel needs. The bike or the fishing rod are included here, depending on the type of trip (examples are a bike tour through Vietnam or a fishing trip to Norway).<br> <br>In principle, luggage is insured against theft in common travel insurances, but only in connection with a break-in (e.g. a locked car was broken into). Damage caused by fire and natural hazards are also mostly damage<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://versicherungsblog.lamie-direkt.at/naturgefahren-haushaltsversicherung&amp;usg=ALkJrhiJQmYs2df5LPo7dMMLGIjVOlFmkg" target="_blank"></a> (Damage caused by natural forces) or insured by a traffic accident.</p>

<p><strong>As soon as Indian summer has passed, autumn usually immediately lets us feel its presence. The changed weather conditions alone bring with them a wide variety of dangers, which you have to adjust to every year. We have put together a list of the most important to-dos and insurance tips for you so that you can get through autumn safely.</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Living</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>1. Twilight time is break-in time</strong></h5>



<p>Due to the early twilight in the months of October to March, burglars strike particularly often between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. According to the police, the apartments and houses affected are usually well connected to main traffic routes, which enables the perpetrators to swear quickly. The focus is on residential areas with hard-to-see properties and apartments at ground level.</p>



<p>Simple tips for protection against break-ins, especially at dusk, include:</p>



<ul><li>Use timers and illuminate basement exits.</li><li>Attach motion detectors.</li><li>Install the most complete outdoor lighting possible .</li><li>Check for typical break-in vulnerabilities .</li></ul>



<p> What you need to look out for so that household insurance pays in the event of a break-in can be found in our blog post on the subject of burglary .</p>



<h5><strong>2. Clear leaves</strong></h5>



<p>According to § 93 StVO, homeowners are obliged to clear public sidewalks, sidewalks and stairs adjacent to their own property. Although these provisions are mostly only associated with the classic &#8220;snow removal and gritting obligations&#8221; in winter, the removal of leaves also falls under this obligation, for example when wet leaves endanger the safety of pedestrians. Renters take note &#8211; homeowners can delegate the responsibility of clearing the sidewalk to their tenants. Then these stick if, for example, a pedestrian slips in front of the house and injures himself.<br>Attention: It is forbidden to sweep the leaves from the sidewalk onto the street if this endangers road safety (§ 92 StVO).</p>



<p><br> <br> Also, don&#8217;t forget to clear private walkways on your property. As a signpost, you are responsible for ensuring that pavements can be used safely by authorized persons.</p>



<h3><strong>Drive</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>3. Foliage and aquaplaning</strong></h5>



<p>Early fog, rain showers and wind &#8211; even a driver has to get used to the gruesome autumn weather. Leaves lying around or heavy rainfalls in autumn can cause a lot of sliding on some roads. Extreme caution is required on wet roads and in poor visibility. Keep your distance and expect a longer braking distance!</p>



<p> Do you think that none of this is a problem with your comprehensive insurance? Do not lull yourself into a false sense of security. In the event of accident damage to your own car that you yourself caused negligently, for example because you did not reduce your speed sufficiently despite heavy rain, the comprehensive insurance is not obliged to pay for the damage. However, some insurance companies offer protection in the event of gross negligence for an additional charge. Check your insurance contract!</p>



<h5><strong>4. Game crossing</strong></h5>



<p>In autumn, drivers must expect more deer passages at dawn and dusk &#8211; especially in rural areas.</p>



<p>Warning: If you brake because of an animal, you risk contributing to a rear-end collision. Contributory negligence means that you then bear part of the damage yourself or have to compensate the driver for part of the damage. Whether the braking maneuver is justified and not contributing to your negligence depends on the size of the animal. The larger the animal, the more likely it is that the danger to self and property justifies an emergency stop; for example with deer, stag and large dogs; but not with hedgehogs, rabbits and cats.</p>



<p> If you can no longer avoid &#8220;Bambi&#8221;, the comprehensive insurance pays for the damage to your own car. The game damage must be reported to the police immediately.</p>



<h5><strong>5. Rockfall</strong></h5>



<p>As soon as the road conditions get worse in autumn, the gravel also increases on the road. Then it can happen that a pebble is caught by the tire of a vehicle and thrown against the windshield of the vehicle behind it.</p>



<p> The comprehensive insurance covers damage to windshields due to falling rocks. Without comprehensive insurance, you can only claim damages from the motor vehicle liability insurance of the vehicle in front if he is driving on the shoulder of the road or driving at excessive speed in poor road conditions.</p>



<h5><strong>6. Tire change</strong></h5>



<p>In Austria, winter tires are compulsory from November 1st to April 15th in winter driving conditions (snow, mud or ice). For more safety in poor road conditions and colder temperatures (less than 7 ° C), it is advisable to convert to winter tires beforehand. Because the higher profile depth of the winter tires (at least 4 mm) and the softer rubber compound ensure better traction.</p>



<p>Heavy rains, hail and storms are not uncommon even in autumn. Our blog post on the topic of storms tells you what you need to think about so that the insurance pays in the event of damage.</p>

<p><strong>While family members are usually (co) insured with statutory health and accident insurance, this is often not the case with private insurance. Our LAMIE experts have summarized for you where and when you need to apply for co-insurance, what common mistakes there are and what you should be aware of. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Mistake No. 1: Children in education are always insured in the statutory health insurance</strong></h3>



<p>So only children under the age of 18 are automatically insured with their parents. If the school education takes longer, you can apply for co-insurance under certain conditions. To do this, the child must be under the age of 27, be eligible for family allowance (or provide proof of academic achievement) and he or she must not earn more than the marginal earnings threshold. This also applies to stepchildren, children of choice, grandchildren or foster children.<br> <br><br> <br>In addition, spouses, registered partners and domestic partners who do not have health insurance and other family members who run the household free of charge can also be insured with the statutory health insurance.</p>



<h3><strong>Error number 2: Family members are automatically included in the accident insurance</strong></h3>



<p>The statutory accident insurance covers people in training, at work and kindergarten children (from the compulsory kindergarten year and for at least 16 hours). Small children, housewives and pensioners do not have this protection.<br>Benefits for consequential damage from an accident are only paid for accidents at work, in kindergarten, at school, on the way there and at related events. There is no protection for accidents in leisure time , at home, during sports or on vacation.<br>In addition, family members are not insured with anyone here. Everyone is self-insured as soon as they meet the above requirements. No contributions are collected from the insured; it is financed by the AUVA and a contribution from the family burden compensation fund.</p>



<p>A private family accident insurance (preferably with worldwide coverage) is necessary for adequate accident protection in leisure time and at home.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<h3></h3>



<h3><strong>Mistake no. 3: Household and liability insurance: Co-insurance for everyone in the household</strong></h3>



<p>In household insurance, including private liability insurance, it is often assumed that children are also insured as long as they live in the same household as their parents, even when they are adults. The fact is, however, that the criteria for co-insurance can be very different and mostly depend on age (usually up to 25 or 27 years of age), marital status, education or whether family allowances are received. If the child starts working life, the co-insurance usually expires. Children who are gainfully employed or who do not meet the above criteria must be included in the insurance contract if they still live at home.</p>



<p>Many insurers offer to insure the children&#8217;s household effects at the place of study. However, this protection is usually limited and applies to student dormitories, boarding schools or possibly to shared apartments. In addition, some of the exceptions are that the insurance cover only applies to liability, but not to the contents of the apartment. If this is the case, a separate household insurance should be taken out for the student apartment , where all roommates including their household are insured.</p>



<p>In general, only family members and partners are insured free of charge in household insurance. So if you live with a friend, he usually has to be included in the contract.</p>



<p><strong>LAMIE tip</strong> : In the LAMIE direct household  insurance including liability insurance, the  contents of <strong>all residents registered in the household are</strong> automatically insured.<br> <br></p>



<h3><strong>Misconception No. 4: In the event of death, family members are entitled to private life and pension insurance</strong></h3>



<p>At the latest when building a house and starting a family, you should think about an end and / or life insurance. Particularly important here is the lump-sum settlement, with which, for example, mortgages can be repaid in the event of death and the surviving dependents can thus have a debt-free apartment to live on.<br>In the case of an existing or a new life insurance or private pension insurance, a specific person can be included in the contract as a beneficiary. The sum is paid directly to this beneficiary. Otherwise, the life insurance of a deceased falls into the estate and is divided among the family members in accordance with Austrian inheritance law .</p>



<h3><strong>Misconception No. 5: Co-insurance of family members with credit card travel insurance</strong></h3>



<p>With many credit card insurances, family members are also insured when traveling. At least that is always highlighted. However, if you look at the details of the various conditions, you will notice that certain services &#8211; such as important travel health insurance &#8211; are often limited to the cardholder. You can find more about this in our large credit card travel insurance comparison .</p>



<p>With other private insurances such as annual travel insurance, legal expenses insurance or private health insurance, you must also insure family members separately or take out family insurance.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to build a house or have it built, you should </strong><strong>always </strong><strong>be prepared </strong><strong>for construction defects, postponements and the associated </strong><strong>, protracted </strong><strong>disputes with</strong> <strong>construction companies </strong><strong>. Because these are not uncommon in construction practice. </strong><strong>A lack of expert knowledge </strong><strong>and a </strong><strong>lack of consultation between construction companies </strong><strong>can quickly turn the dream of a house into a nightmare. </strong><strong>In </strong><strong>addition, </strong><strong>construction defects </strong><strong>are not apparent to </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>layperson and damage can only become apparent years later. </strong><strong>We clarify </strong><strong>who is liable and what you can do in the event of construction defects or damage.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the event that you are not so familiar with the terms used in construction, we have two important definitions for you to begin with .&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Client</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The builder is the person who is responsible for the preparation or execution of development on a property or who commissions this. If you have bought a plot of land and would like to have a house built on it, you are the owner.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Site manager and site manager</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The builder himself (if he has the necessary training) or a person representing him (e.g. from a building or general contractor ) can be appointed as site manager. He coordinated the site , ensures that all construction companies such as plumbers, roofers , Ele k triker etc. e fficient work together , controlled compliance with the requirements, costs, and is the contact person for &#8221; home builders &#8221; .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The site manager is a subordinate employee of the site manager , can represent him to a certain extent and is responsible for the implementation of partial tasks on the construction site. Both the site manager and site manager must be notified to the client before the work begins 1&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>What can construction companies be held liable for </strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A construction company is liable to the client for quality, deadlines and defects. If a general contractor is commissioned, it also bears the economic and organizational risk.</p>



<p>But responsibility is not only towards one&#8217;s own work, but in some ways also to d s preparations other personnel working at the same site sub-firms . Namely, the own work on a defective preliminary work on construction , threatening the building contractor at a loss , the loss of one&#8217;s right to compensation for work , even if the job basically was carried out properly . So there is a certain duty to warn the builder and not just quietly respond to a r unclean basis.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>What to do in the event of construction defects </strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The biggest problem with building defects that they are often hidden and L a ien not be recognized under normal circumstances, at least not before it is too late or already damage occurred. Then what&#8217;s the best way to get your money back? First of all, there is an important distinction between warranty and compensation with regard to when the defect is discovered.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Guarantee</strong> </h4>



<p>The property developer is entitled to a warranty for 3 years from handover, but for the thing itself, i.e. for the defect, not for the consequential damage. If construction defects are recognizable after a certain period of time (within 3 years) , the buyer must prove that these were already present at the time of handover. It is therefore always advisable to precisely document any construction progress using photos.<br>However, it is legally assumed that a defect that occurs within six months of handover already existed at the time of handover. Depending on the type and severity of the defect, the buyer or dthe client assert the rectification of defects, replacement, price reduction or repayment of the purchase price. The best case here would of course be to identify the defect before paying. As long as there is a defect, the house does not have to be taken over and the payment to the respective construction company does not have to be made.<br>So it gives an idea of ​​how complicated things can get. At the slightest suspicion of improper construction, or a tree Angels you should immediately contact an independent expert.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Compensation</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Entitled to compensation has one only if already a damage has occurred and it is proved by means verifier that the underlying tree Angel the cause for this was is. The period from knowledge of the damage and the damaging party is also 3 years. For this it is important that everything is well documented and that all indications point to the guilt of the respective construction company. As soon as wear and tear are involved, or there is an extraordinary chain of circumstances, this could lead to a reduction in liability or even exclusion of liability from construction companies .There is one major benefit to you, however. As previously mentioned, claims for damages only become statute-barred after three years <strong>FROM KNOWLEDGE of</strong> the damage, but at most after 30 years from acceptance of the structure. In other words, if the damage only occurs after 10 years, i.e. long after the existing warranty period, then you have 3 years from this point in time to assert claims through compensation law.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How do I protect myself against unpredictable events?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<h4><strong>Construction insurance</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Not all damage can be traced back to human error, and the whims of nature can quickly cause major problems. One way for building owners to protect themselves extensively is construction insurance.</p>



<p>Such a &#8220;construction comprehensive insurance&#8221; covers on the one hand consequential damage caused by natural events such as Rain, storm, hail, falling rocks, earthquakes and much more. and on the other hand damage that can also be attributed to the building contractor. This includes, among other things, consequential damage caused by execution errors, clumsiness, failure of supporting structures or falling objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Natural hazards: The excavation pit is full due to heavy rain; the properly secured construction crane falls over in a raging storm and damages the roof.&nbsp;</li><li>Unsuitable execution by the construction company: Due to the too thin foundation, the house tilts / rises or falls.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h5><strong>Insurance contract liability</strong>&nbsp;</h5>



<p>It is also possible to secure the property for a period of 36 months after completion of the construction. The so-called &#8220;Extended Maintenance&#8221; covers damage that originated during the construction period (such as leaky pipelines).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It often happens, however, that damage appears much later, although it occurred much earlier. If the ( property ) damage due to incorrect construction was already set in the construction stage, this is usually covered even after the insurance cover has expired . In any case, you can report the damage to your insurance company within 36 months &#8211; this is also the duration of the warranty for buildings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building insurance has a significant advantage for the builder, because he does not have to deal with the trade, but can coordinate directly with the insurer.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Shell insurance</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Another way to cover yourself would be to take out shell insurance. A shell insurance protects you against damage caused by force majeure such as. Fire and storm have arisen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> When you take out <a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;pto=aue&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://versicherungsblog.lamie-direkt.at/must-haves-eigenheimversicherung&amp;usg=ALkJrhihqNCNuGRHeUPKT4kpXJt5Hgy06Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">home</a> insurance, many insurers give you shell insurance free of charge. This means that the first premium is usually only due when the house is ready for occupancy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Damage to third parties&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>As the client, you have the duty to secure the construction site. Among other things, you must ensure that no one is injured or property is damaged. If damage occurs to the neighbors or other third parties as a result of a construction site, the builder is fully liable to the injured party, even without guilt. Private individuals are liable as builders with their private assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A sensible protection for this would be a <strong>builder&#8217;s</strong> liability insurance . This protects you from financial burdens caused by claims for damages that are made against you as the client. A possible damage scenario would be, for example. the damage to the neighboring building due to excavation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even after the completion of the building and now a proud homeowner, incidents can occur for which you are liable to third parties for damages.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Examples:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Someone is slipping on your property because you did not clear the snow and therefore violated the traffic safety obligation.&nbsp;</li><li>A tree in the garden falls on a car parked in front of the house.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In order to be protected in such situations, it is advisable to take out <strong>home and property liability insurance</strong> .&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Info:</strong> When you take out homeowner insurance, you can usually include home and property liability as a component in the contract. Find out more about this from your insurer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basically, it can be said that defects or damage that occur, which are becoming more and more common despite improved building materials and technologies , are not easy to drink and involve a lot of effort, time and often also legal disputes. Therefore, the top rule is to always agree on reasonable payment methods and never pay in advance. It also avoids losing a lot of money in the event of a construction company going bankrupt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
