<p>Neighbours of this house in Madagascar have had to show a lot of patience before something was actually done, but in the end it got reported to the authorities. The next door neighbours noticed a very strong and strange smell coming from the house, but they really didn’t know what the smell could be. Clearly, there was something going on, but no one involved in this strange smelly case could have expected to find what they actually discovered when they went in and investigated the house. </p>



<p><strong>How did the neighbourhood get so stinky?</strong></p>



<p>It is difficult to know what the right attitude is when you notice a really bad smell coming from a house in your neighbourhood. For most of the neighbours who lived close by, it was a sign that the house had probably been abandoned and that no one lived there anymore. But what really happened was actually something very different from that. </p>



<p><strong>Painful suffocation</strong></p>



<p>At some point, people living in the neighbourhood started to really suffocate because of the smell. It was really unbearable and they just wonder how there could be such a bad smell coming from a place where no one lived. It really was a good question, and the neighbours needed some answers. </p>



<p>At first, the neighbours really couldn’t figure out where the smell came from, and they figured that the best thing to do was just to try and ignore it. They assumed that at some point the smell would disappear, but it actually never did. There weren’t a lot of solutions, and to blame each other would just make everything worse. In the end, everyone assumed the smell came from a nearby abandoned house, but they also knew they were going to need to do something about it.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Although everyone believed the house was abandoned, the neighbours saw people go in and out of it, and realised they were wrong. When they discovered this, they were in shock, as they couldn’t believe that people would actually willingly go anywhere near the stinky house – and even worse, inside it. </p>



<p>At that point, all the residents were really wondering what was the cause of such a bad smell. Suddenly, everyone was happy to realise that the smell disappeared, and they believed they got rid of it for good. But unfortunately, it came back. The community thought that it would be the end of the story, but it was only going to be the beginning of it.</p>



<h2><strong>The returning smell</strong></h2>



<p>When it went away, everyone believed they would not need to worry about the bad smell anymore, but unfortunately it resurfaced. Then the neighbours decided to organise a reunion in order to decide what they should do. At that point, everyone believed they knew where the smell was coming from, but they also knew they couldn’t just go inside on their own.</p>



<p>Desperate with the situation, the neighbours finally decided it was time to contact the authorities. They explained the situation to the police officers, and argued that it was starting to become a big problem in the community. After they listened to the story, the officers came up with a good explanation regarding the smell. </p>



<h2><strong>Being prepared</strong></h2>



<p>When they received the call, police officers started an investigation and even asked a few neighbours to come with them, in order to go around the house more easily. Because they didn’t know what they were going to walk into or what they would find when entering the house, the police officers made sure to be prepared for any situation. They knew that if something went wrong, they had a team of specialists with them, including a medical examiner and a wildlife expert. </p>



<p>Soary Randrianjafizanaka was part of the wildlife committee that the authorities called for help. Her department usually gets called when there are issues of foul smell, and being the agency head she made the decision to come and see the house for herself. She might also have been curious because she lived in the area. But although Randrianjafizanaka thought she knew what was inside the house, she actually had the wrong idea. </p>



<p>This story takes place in Toliara, a city on the southwest coast of Madagascar in East Africa. Not only is the city very pretty and famous for being a peaceful place, but it is also quite paradisiac and has many beautiful beaches such as the one pictured here. </p>



<p>It is pretty unusual for neighbours not to manage to live together peacefully. Since the city was a good and safe place to live, the police officers struggled to imagine this could be a case of foul play. For that reason, they called Randrianjafizanaka because they thought it could be animal-related instead. </p>



<h2><strong>A varied experience </strong></h2>



<p>At that point, the Environmental Agency existed for a while and had experienced many different strange and unusual situations involving animals. They had seen everything and every type of animal, from poor kittens to dangerous predators. But the real question at that point was which type of animal it was going to be that time. </p>



<p>It was common for the agency to work with different animals in the region, which explains why the authorities usually contact them when they think that there is an animal involved in the case they are investigating. Even then, the authorities really did not know what was going to happen with the investigation. </p>



<p>When the team arrived at the house, they immediately realised there was a very pungent smell, even though they could not understand what it was exactly. Because of her job, Randrianjafizanaka was used to seeing a lot of different things, but this particular situation was a bit difficult for her because she wasn’t able to figure out what the cause of the smell was. And it was the same for the rest of the team – no one knew what the smell was, so they all entered the house confused and uncertain. </p>



<p>If you forget about the smell that came from it, the house just looked pretty normal and big from the outside. It wasn’t anyone’s first reaction to think there was a big dark secret inside, but it was very quiet and therefore felt quite eerie. Everyone thought it was strange to abandon such a nice house, but there was absolutely no sign anywhere that it was on the market and about to be sold. </p>



<p><br>As soon as the police and experts entered the house, they started to feel lightheaded because of the smell. Although it was a very strong and uneasy feeling, they knew they couldn’t turn back and needed to investigate. They still didn’t know where the smell came from and kept on looking for the explanation. According to Randrianjafizanaka, it could be animal waste, and she told everyone else about her opinion. But let’s discover whether she was right or not! </p>



<p>At that point, Randrianjafizanaka really believed the smell was caused by animals since she knew from experience that trapped animals can be responsible for this type of smell. But she wasn’t sure she could completely exclude someone living in the house as well. However, when she looked at the inside of the house, she concluded that no one lived there. The team had numerous questions about the house, and they were about to get some answers. </p>



<p>The investigation of the house continued, but suddenly the team heard a noise that made everyone stop. It wasn’t anything loud but everyone heard it and wondered. They realised they weren’t alone and started to act very carefully. What happened is that there were other people, and the two sides were very shocked by the situation. Both the police and the experts actually got very confused. </p>



<h2><strong>Digging holes</strong></h2>



<p>Finally, the team ended up meeting the people making noise, who were holding shovels. The people in the house were actually digging holes as fast as possible, which really confused the team. Besides, they were surrounded by objects – and the officers and experts didn’t know what was happening at all. They had a few ideas, but when they actually discovered the truth, it was completely unexpected. For a start, they believed the house was empty when it wasn’t.  </p>



<p>When the team came up to them and asked what they were doing, the diggers became strange, which really wasn’t a surprise. Clearly, there was something wrong going on, and the diggers also looked like they were hiding something. The police officers immediately recognised this type of look – when they came close, the diggers just dropped the shovels as if they were burning. But still, the team didn’t know what was going on. What were they doing? </p>



<h2><strong>The arrest</strong></h2>



<p>The diggers immediately realised they were in trouble – they dropped their shovels and put their hands up in the air. They didn’t even try to run away and decided to cooperate instead, which convinced the police they were doing something wrong. The officers therefore apprehended them, and then went back inside to look at what they were hiding. But unfortunately, going back inside meant they had to suffer the horrible smell once again. </p>



<p>  </p>



<p>When they entered the house again, the team realised it was badly destroyed. It looked like everything was falling apart- the windows and ceilings were covered in cobwebs and there was no light. Although they had apprehended some people, the officers still didn’t know where the bad smell was coming from. </p>



<h2><strong>An incredible discovery</strong></h2>



<p>Later on, they looked more carefully and made an incredible discovery. They suddenly realised that the floor appeared to be moving in different rooms, which really shocked and surprised them. They quickly understood what was going on, and it started to make sense. </p>



<p>The incredible thing that the team discovered is that the floor was covered with tortoises. There were so many that they were packed and looked like sardines. It was a big shock for the team who stood there, looking at them in disbelief. </p>



<h2><strong>Special creatures</strong></h2>



<p>As soon as she saw the tortoises, Randrianjafizanaka realised they were not regular ones. She immediately knew where they came from, but there were so many of the poor things everywhere that it was pretty impossible to still manage to see the floor. </p>



<p>Because of her position, Randrianjafizanaka immediately reacted and understood what she had to do. She knew the tortoises needed to be moved somewhere else, and somewhere suitable and safe. It was a real shock for her to see the conditions the animals were living in, and to see that there were so many of them. </p>



<p>The animals had gone through a horrible treatment for a long time, so Randrianjafizanaka knew that some of them would need intense care immediately, or that they could die. It was going to be a long and difficult job for sure, but the more they would wait, the more things would get difficult to fix. </p>



<h2><strong>Rare tortoises</strong></h2>



<p>Randrianjafizanaka’s first instinct that the tortoises were a special species was right. They were actually radiated tortoises, which are very rare and usually cannot be found in the wild. In Madagascar, there are actually just a few species that are native from there. </p>



<h2><strong>Distinctive creatures</strong></h2>



<p>You can recognise radiated tortoises thanks to their docile nature and unique markings on their shells. Soon enough, Randrianjafizanaka and her team discovered why the diggers were in possession of these creatures, which explained at the same time their behaviour and the reason why they surrendered so quickly. </p>



<p>Because of how rare they are, radiated tortoises are often a target for poachers. Some people even took the habit of eating them, as if they were a delicacy. And of course, some people really want to have them as pets. But none of this changes the fact that it is illegal to be in possession of these rare tortoises.</p>



<h2><strong>The black market</strong></h2>



<p>What is certain is that even if there are laws, people still break them. Many people have illegal businesses in place where they poach the animals and then sell them on the black market. For this reason, this particular species of tortoises has almost gone extinct. But of course, this is a particularly odious example. </p>



<p>At some point in the past, this species was thriving, but then it started to change and dramatically decrease. When the team got inside the house, they realised there were a lot of tortoises in there, but they couldn’t tell just how many by looking at them. In the end, someone counted them and they were apparently 9,000 all stuck inside the house. </p>



<h2><strong>A massive decline</strong></h2>



<p>The number of tortoises had been declining for a while now. In the 1990s, their population was apparently about 12 million, which is already pretty low, but by 2010 it went down again and only reached 6 million. Even worse, today this number got halved again and is only now at a very small 3 million. </p>



<p>Because of that, even if the conditions the tortoises lived in were horrible, the team was actually really happy to come across them, as it meant they recovered thousands of them. Because they were in such bad conditions when they found them, the team had to be extremely careful when moving the tortoises to a safer place. </p>



<p>In the end, the team came across a big number of tortoises, and were delighted to have helped them out. But it wasn’t over and it looked like something was not going so well after all. Get ready and keep on reading to find out what it was! </p>
