<p>Do you know how sometimes you get so caught up in a wildlife documentary that you feel completely attached to the animals’ stories? This is how you’ll feel reading this article. Because it’s more than just an article, it’s a story about facing adversity, the power of nature, and the kindness of strangers.</p>



<p>Read on to learn more about the heroic tale of a mother bear and her two cubs defying all odds to swim across a freezing lake in Russia. It didn’t go as planned, however. Read on to learn of the heroic tale.</p>



<h5><strong>01. A Tale of Loss, and Love</strong></h5>



<p>We are not even over exaggerating when we say, this story will warm your hearts. It is about sacrifice and hope, fear and loss. It is about the unspoken bond of a loving family and two different species coming together to save lives.</p>



<p>When a mother bear left her cubs for dead in the middle of a bitterly cold lake, the cubs were in need of a saviour. Luckily, some fishermen nearby embarked on a rescue mission – but did they succeed?</p>



<h5><strong>02. An Unforgiving Lake</strong></h5>



<p>The tale begins on a freshwater lake known as Lake Vygozero, in the northwestern region of Russia. This body of water is so incredibly cold that temperatures have been known to go down to -4 degrees Fahrenheit, or -20 degrees Celsius (safe to say that this lake isn’t a major water-skiing destination!)</p>



<p>Given the lake’s large size and freezing temperatures, it is far too cold for humans and most other wildlife (apart from fish!) to swim in.  It is impossible to make it from one side to another without getting a bitter chill. With this in mind – continue reading to find out what happens to the baby bears that were stranded in this unforgivingly cold lake.</p>



<h5><strong>03. Somewhere to Get To</strong></h5>



<p>It is unclear, and we may never know why the mother bear decided to cross these waters with her newborn cubs. However, the maternal instinct is powerful in most species, especially bears.</p>



<p>So when she stood at the edge, felt the bite of the cold water, and decided to jump in anyway, we wonder what motivated her to keep going. She was one tough lady bear – although this, unfortunately, put her two little ones in danger as they were not as tough as she may have thought.</p>



<h5><strong>04. A Terrible Decision</strong></h5>



<p>Unfortunately, the decision to jump into the lake with her two cubs was not a safe one. With them clinging onto her back, her strength and will was just not enough in the freezing temperature.</p>



<p>They began their journey across the lake, but after some time it became all too clear that she couldn’t keep going while holding their weight and that the cubs just couldn’t keep up. The cubs eventually ended up far out in the lake’s centre, scrambling for dear life with no idea of where to go from there.</p>



<h5><strong>05. A Harsh Sacrifice</strong></h5>



<p>Now the story takes a painful twist. Mother bears have been known to be selfless animals willing to sacrifice themselves for their young when their maternal instincts kick in. However, this wasn’t the case with this mother bear.</p>



<p>Regardless of her initial intentions, she ultimately ditched her cubs and started to swim away, leaving them helpless in the water. This decision may baffle some wildlife observers, however, when it comes to life and death in the wild, survival instincts seem to have overridden this momma bear’s maternal ones.</p>



<h5><strong>06. The Current was Too Strong</strong></h5>



<p>We have to give her some credit though, as the lake had a very powerful undercurrent, which was already incredibly difficult to swim in. She did try, but ultimately after battling the current with her babies on her back, she found herself being torn apart from her cubs.</p>



<p>After being separated, she tried to save herself, possibly hoping that her cubs could make it on their own. After swimming for some time, the mother bear eventually made it safely to land. Sadly, without her baby cubs.</p>



<h5><strong>07. Somebody Help!</strong></h5>



<p>So now we find the bear cubs alone, exhausted, and desperate in this freezing lake. How will they survive now that their mother – their protector – has abandoned them? With nobody even close to saving them, it wasn’t looking good.</p>



<p>The odds were totally against them, especially since young bears do not generally have much experience swimming in general and this being the middle of winter with frigid waters, with a deadly current.</p>



<h5><strong>08. Holding for Dear Life</strong></h5>



<p>This picture makes our hearts hurt. Can you imagine what this would be like for these baby cubs? Terror and panic running through their minds while the cold water rushed over them? Within minutes of being in the lake, they were trying to fight for their lives.</p>



<p>Even though they are not human, treading water in the face of death would be enough for any living being to be absolutely terrified. Whoever was photographing as this, might have thought that he was capturing the end of the lives of these cubs.</p>



<h5><strong>09. A Rescue on The Horizon?</strong></h5>



<p>When all seemed hopeless for these little cubs, magically, a boat appeared. Quickly, the situation became clear – it was a race against the clock to save the scared little ones from drowning.</p>



<p>The fishermen were well acquainted with the lake and knew something was wrong. With no momma bear in sight, they knew that they had to do something to help rescue them. Could they do it?</p>



<h5><strong>10. Tired Little Ones</strong></h5>



<p>As the boat got closer to the cubs, the disastrous situation became clear. The babies were incredibly exhausted and struggling to keep their heads above the water, and the crew didn’t know how to safely pluck them out of the water.</p>



<p>Ironically instead of catching fish, they were now hoping to catch themselves two little bear cubs and hopefully bring them to safety but it wasn’t as easy as it sounded. The cubs were scared of the boat and were panicking.</p>



<h5><strong>11. An Observer Close by</strong></h5>



<p>Though the mother bear left the babies in the water, she was still very close by on the shore, watching the whole scene unfold. As this mother was a rather large bear the fisherman was unsure whether to proceed, in fear for their own safety.</p>



<p>The bear still had a strong maternal instinct and they feared that the mother might try to intervene and climb aboard their vessel. Even though time was running out, they had to wait for the mother to be a safer distance away.</p>



<h5><strong>12. Creating a Plan</strong></h5>



<p>As they waited, the fishermen decided to work out a plan for how to get the babies out of the water. What was the best way to handle this situation? What would be the best way to put themselves and the cubs in the least amount of danger?</p>



<p>They had to approach the situation with caution and in a way which the cubs would not get further frighted, as anything could happen. While they were just babies, they were still wild baby bears.</p>



<h5><strong>13. Get it on Camera</strong></h5>



<p>We should give thanks to modern technology since it is allowing us to get this first-hand experience at a once-in-a-lifetime rescue mission. The fisherman said that started taking pictures because they thought their friends wouldn’t believe them!</p>



<p>The fisherman, themselves couldn’t believe that what they came across on a casual winter fishing outing. They filmed the entire interaction when the bears and boat. Soon after, one of the bear cubs started to try to enter the boat on his own, reaching with his paws.</p>



<h5><strong>14. Needing Some Assistance</strong></h5>



<p>The ledge of the boat was much too high for the little one, and try as he may, he just couldn’t make it onto the boat himself, especially in his weakened state from treading water so long.</p>



<p>The fishermen thankfully began to set their plan into motion. As a working fishing boat, they had several nets and tools and the most logical option was to use one of them to grab hold of the bear.</p>



<h5><strong>15. The Right Kind of Plan</strong></h5>



<p>As the frantic and wet baby cub desperately tries to climb into the boat, the crew went into motion. One of the fishermen ran to the fishing gear to latch onto the cubs and bring them on board.</p>



<p>Bears have incredibly sharp teeth and powerful mouth-gripping abilities. So instead of pulling the cub into the boat, the plan was to let the cub use his mouth as leverage to pull himself up onto the vessel.</p>



<h5><strong>16. Did it Work?</strong></h5>



<p>At first, it seemed like the plan would work, however, the bear was still a bit too far from the boat landing to be able to pull his whole body up. The crew was worried that the large net might just scare the bear, even more.</p>



<p>So even though the fishermen were concerned about their own safety if they physically pulled the bear up, they also couldn’t just sit back and watch. It was a matter of life and death, and they decided that they had to intervene.</p>



<h5><strong>17. Trust and Trust Some More</strong></h5>



<p>If the fishermen reached too far over the edge they risked being pulled down by the bear, falling into the freezing water, or worse – being attacked and maimed. Of course, they couldn’t forget about the giant mama bear, also watching them.</p>



<p>So, what could they do? They decided to throw caution to the wind and put their trust on the bear cubs and decided to work with them to make sure the rescue went smoothly. The fisherman hoped that no one would get hurt.</p>



<h5><strong>18. Please</strong></h5>



<p>A few days after the incident, many of the crew of the boat were quoted as saying that during the rescue, it was as if they have developed an unspoken and deep connection with the bear cub.</p>



<p>Something about locking gazes with the helpless bear created a moment of connection with this vulnerable life. This meant that all the fishermen needed to accept the risk, reach down, and do all they could to save the bear cub.</p>



<h5><strong>19. A Bright Idea</strong></h5>



<p>And so another plan was put into action. Although it seems simple in retrospect at the time, with high stakes and adrenaline pumping, it is understandable that they didn’t try this sooner.</p>



<p>They carefully used their fishing nets to try to scoop the bear out of the water – just like they would have done with regular fish, the trick was to ensure that the cub didn’t panic and stayed very still.</p>



<h5><strong>20. Will it Work?</strong></h5>



<p>The biggest concern about this plan was the fact that the fishing nets were only designed to catch fish – not heavy baby bears. Despite this, they were willing to risk breaking the net if it gave them a chance to save the cubs, so they continued on with their plan.</p>



<p>Tossing the net into the ocean, they started with the first cub. Much like they catch fish, they tried to reel it in with their own hands. Time was running out, and the cub was getting more tired.</p>



<h5>2<strong>1. Heavy Lifting</strong></h5>



<p>The first cub was caught in the net, and brought closer and closer until they eventually got it onto the boat! This was just the beginning, as they had to make sure the bears would not get hurt in the net.</p>



<p>They also had to ensure that the cubs wouldn’t decide to use what little strength they had left to attack the fishermen. Even though the fishermen had good intentions, the scared cubs might not know that and attack them out of fear.</p>



<h5><strong>22. Calming the Cubs</strong></h5>



<p>They expected the wet and wild bear cub to either harm the boat or its helpers, the minute it got out of the water… but at that point, they had to take the risk. Because if not, the bear cub would surely lose its life.</p>



<p>Someone suggested that they try to calm the bear down before they pulled it into the boat but as rugged fishermen without no experience whatsoever on bears or land mammals, everyone was confused as to how to achieve this.</p>



<h5><strong>23. Pull and Pull and Pull</strong></h5>



<p>The fishermen soon realized just how heavy a baby cub was. They were at least grateful that these cubs were still young – imagine if it had been the momma bear stuck in the water!</p>



<p>Did you know that a fully grown bear can weigh up to 1,300 pounds?! That’s a lot of beer. There’s no way the fishermen could have supported one in their fishing net. While they were still cubs, they were heavier than normal because of their wet fur.</p>



<h5><strong>24. Just a Little Further</strong></h5>



<p>It was a good thing that these fishermen were used to tough conditions and situations in this cold climate because pulling the fishing net with the first cub was a real struggle.  They had to dig deep both mentally and physically to help this animal.</p>



<p>After a good deal of time spent on gentle pulling and tugging,  the cub eventually got close enough to the boat to climb onboard. Thankfully, rather than fight everyone, he easily went on and the situation was finally starting to look up.</p>



<h5><strong>25. Welcome Aboard</strong></h5>



<p>So finally, it was a success! They managed to get the first cub on the vessel, but it wasn’t time to celebrate yet.  They still had another cub to save and time was running out. The second cub was treading water the whole time the first rescue had been taking place.</p>



<p>With their first rescue success, they set their eyes on the second cub but unfortunately he was further away from boat than the first one, so the fishermen had to try and get closer to get this one too.</p>



<h5><strong>26. Quiet Confidence</strong></h5>



<p>Since they had successfully rescued the first cub, the fishermen were feeling good about their chances of being able to save this one too but that didn’t mean it was going to be easy.</p>



<p>But thankfully, with their tried and tested method of extraction with the fishing net, the process seemed to go more smoothly than the first time to everyone’s relief. The second cub was picked up and pulled in.</p>



<h5><strong>27. Brother Bears Reunited</strong></h5>



<p>After mustering the strength to continue pulling, the fishermen managed to get this little guy on the boat as well. Now the fishermen felt just as tired as the bears after all of that hard work</p>



<p>With the two bear cubs safely on the boat, there was a sense of euphoria on the boat. Their average workday was turned upside down but ended with success but the fishermen were left with a big question. What do they do now?</p>



<h5><strong>28. Celebration</strong></h5>



<p>The fishermen could finally take a moment to celebrate – a few high fives and cheers were shared between them. With the two cubs saved, they could breathe and prepare themselves for the next move.</p>



<p>We’re truly impressed with the fishermen’s ability to persevere and selflessly save these little ones. The next move in question was to return the bear cubs to the mother but this would involve its own risks.</p>
